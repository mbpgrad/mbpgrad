# Repository Description
This repo was intended for Medical Biophysics students or people who are interested in medical image processing, attempting to start from the basics for those who are looking to work with Python.

# Simple Python Setup
After doing things by hand in different programming scenarios, below is a setup that I have used and recommended for ease-of-use Python programming. The general outline will be downloading and installing followed by a quick startup guide:

0. Resources
1. Install Anaconda for package management and virtual environments
2. Install our IDE
3. Installing Git
4. Setting up a virtual environment and using PyCharm
5. Cloning a Github repository in PyCharm
6. Git basics

# Resources
- Here is an incredible resource for learning Python:

- Before starting the setup, if you want to start coding in Python, a great resource that I use constantly in my day-to-day to test how exactly the outputs of functions behave is an online Python interpreter
